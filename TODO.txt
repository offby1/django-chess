IN PROGRESS

TODO
* If the last move put someone in check, note that somewhere!
* Maybe switch to UUIDs for primary keys -- that way when you create a new game, nobody but you knows the URL for it, and you needn't worry about people coming along and playing for you.
* Make the items in the event log clickable -- they take you to the board's state at that point.  I imagine that display should be read-only, since I'm not yet prepared to keep a tree of history for each game.
* How about listing the existing games, and letting me see them via a single click?  Right now I have to manually type in a URL like `http://localhost:8000/game/?game_display_number=3`
* Sometimes it lets me click on a piece, and it highlights; but there are no legal moves.  WTF? I can't remember exactly how I got into this situation; I think I had the king in check and had cliked on some random faraway pawn.  It's not surprising that it has no legal moves, since the only legal moves are either "move the king out of danger", "capture the piece that's endangering the king", or "interpose a piece between the king and its attacker".

  I wonder if this relates to the distinction between "legal" and "pseudo-legal" that the chess library mentions ðŸ¤”

DONE
* Automatically scroll the "moves" list to the end after the page loads.
* I suspect I'm not actually preserving the database between prod deploys.
* Mark the most-recently-moved piece by making it glow or something; it's hard to tell which piece moved.
* Have a toggle switch for each side, controlling whether gnuchess plays for that side.
  Well, actually, I've got a *slider* for just Black, controlling how long gnuchess gets to think for it.
* I've gotten a pawn to the other side of the board, but it didn't magically turn into a queen.
* When we get checkmated, draw the board, as opposed to just showing the "why the game is over" message
* Try eliminating the "Play a move for Black" button, and just have Black always play after White has played.
* Pretty sure I've captured a king, and yet the game never ended -- "Outcome" remained None.
* It'd be nice if there were some visual indicator of WHOSE TURN IT IS
* Don't force people to play both black *and* white; instead, when it's black's turn, have a button that says "do a black move" or something, that picks a black move and makes it.
* Maybe I should, I dunno, teach Black a better strategy than "pick a legal play at random"
* Display a scrolling panel of messages:
  - Each move made
  - when someone captures a piece, display something to tell us "yo, you just captured the knight/pawn/whatever"
  - when we're in check, say so
