IN PROGRESS

TODO
* Look into [Motion-Vue](https://workflowy.com/s/using-a-npm-package/oTup0EX0WArlNYvQ)
* When I import a PGN file, if the file's name has a GUID in it, try to name the imported game after that GUID.
* Tweak the model so that each game has a "provenance" -- if it was uploaded from a PGN, then the name of the file, or perhaps some of the headers in the file; if played interactively, then perhaps the IP address of the client.
  Then, of course, display that provenance on the game.html page.
  Maybe store all the PGN headers as a JSON dict, and restore them when emitting a PGN from that game.
  Failing that, how about just a timestamp?
* Somehow animate the pieces moving.  It sounds hard, but [this site](https://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1472881) and [lichess.org](https://lichess.org/Cg80a2fc) do it.
* If the last move put someone in check, note that somewhere!
* Make the items in the event log clickable -- they take you to the board's state at that point.  I imagine that display should be read-only, since I'm not yet prepared to keep a tree of history for each game.
* Sometimes it lets me click on a piece, and it highlights; but there are no legal moves.  WTF? I can't remember exactly how I got into this situation; I think I had the king in check and had clicked on some random faraway pawn.  It's not surprising that it has no legal moves, since the only legal moves are either "move the king out of danger", "capture the piece that's endangering the king", or "interpose a piece between the king and its attacker".

  I wonder if this relates to the distinction between "legal" and "pseudo-legal" that the chess library mentions ðŸ¤”
* Let both White and Black be controllable: either side can be played by the human (clicking stuff on the web page) or the bot.

DONE
* At least for development convenience: allow saving and restoring games to a local file.  Maybe use pgn format.
* Show the (two) collections of captured pieces.
* Dumb down Black even futher, by only invoking it on some moves, and choosing a random legal move otherwise.
* See what, if anything, needs to be done to ensure the docker compose stack comes up automatically after I reboot the big host.
  It looks like caddy automatically restarts; I wonder if it's as simple as adding `restart: unless-stopped` (caddy's compose file has that; mine doesn't).
* Automatically scroll the "moves" list to the end after the page loads.
  I thought I'd done this, but it's done wrong: it scrolls the entire page, thus (on mobile) pushing the board off the top; I want instead to *just* scroll the div that contains the individual moves.

  To reproduce:
  - adjust the window so that the event log is *below* the board, as opposed to being to the right of the board
  - make a move
  - observe that the bottom of the event log is indeed visible, but the top of the board no longer is.
* How about listing the existing games, and letting me see them via a single click?  Right now I have to manually type in a URL like `http://localhost:8000/game/?game_display_number=3`

  OTOH, I don't want random strangers to be able to futz with a game in progress; perhaps I should list only *completed* games.
* Maybe switch to UUIDs for primary keys -- that way when you create a new game, nobody but you knows the URL for it, and you needn't worry about people coming along and playing for you.
* I suspect I'm not actually preserving the database between prod deploys.
* Mark the most-recently-moved piece by making it glow or something; it's hard to tell which piece moved.
* Have a toggle switch for each side, controlling whether gnuchess plays for that side.
  Well, actually, I've got a *slider* for just Black, controlling how long gnuchess gets to think for it.
* I've gotten a pawn to the other side of the board, but it didn't magically turn into a queen.
* When we get checkmated, draw the board, as opposed to just showing the "why the game is over" message
* Try eliminating the "Play a move for Black" button, and just have Black always play after White has played.
* Pretty sure I've captured a king, and yet the game never ended -- "Outcome" remained None.
* It'd be nice if there were some visual indicator of WHOSE TURN IT IS
* Don't force people to play both black *and* white; instead, when it's black's turn, have a button that says "do a black move" or something, that picks a black move and makes it.
* Maybe I should, I dunno, teach Black a better strategy than "pick a legal play at random"
* Display a scrolling panel of messages:
  - Each move made
  - when someone captures a piece, display something to tell us "yo, you just captured the knight/pawn/whatever"
  - when we're in check, say so
