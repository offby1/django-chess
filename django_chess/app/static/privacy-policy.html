    <h1>Privacy Policy for Offby1 Chess</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: January 13, 2026</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Offby1 Chess ("we", "our", or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy.
        This Privacy Policy explains how information is handled when you use our Android chess application.
    </p>

    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Offby1 Chess does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information about you.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        The app operates by connecting to a chess server where game data is stored. However:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>No user accounts or registration are required</li>
        <li>No personally identifiable information is collected</li>
        <li>No email addresses, names, or contact information are requested</li>
        <li>No usage analytics or tracking data is collected</li>
        <li>No advertising identifiers are used</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Permissions Used</h2>
    <p>The app requests the following Android permissions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>INTERNET</strong>: Required to connect to chess servers and synchronize game data</li>
        <li><strong>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE</strong>: Used to check network connectivity before making API calls to provide a better user experience</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        These permissions are used solely for the app's core functionality of playing chess games
        and are not used for any data collection purposes.
    </p>

    <h2>Game Data</h2>
    <p>
        When you play games in Offby1 Chess, the following data is sent to the configured chess server:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Chess moves (in UCI notation, e.g., "e2e4")</li>
        <li>Game state (board position, whose turn, etc.)</li>
        <li>AI difficulty setting</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This data is associated with a randomly generated game ID (UUID) and is not linked to you personally.
        Games are accessible only by knowing the game ID.
    </p>

    <h2>Server Configuration</h2>
    <p>
        The app allows you to configure custom chess servers. By default, it connects to
        <code>https://chess.offby1.info</code>. When you play games, move data is sent to your
        configured server.
    </p>
    <p>
        Server URL preferences are stored locally on your device and are never transmitted to us or any third party.
    </p>

    <h2>Local Data Storage</h2>
    <p>The app stores the following data locally on your device:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Server URL configuration</li>
        <li>App preferences and settings</li>
        <li>Cached game data for offline viewing</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This data remains on your device and is deleted if you uninstall the app.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
        The app does not use any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.
        The only network communication is with the chess server you configure.
    </p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        The app does not knowingly collect any information from children. No registration,
        personal information, or accounts are required to use the app, making it suitable for users of all ages.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>
        Since the app does not collect personal information, there is no personal data to secure.
        Game data transmitted to servers is sent over HTTPS (encrypted connections) when available.
    </p>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>
        Since no personal data is collected, there is no personal information to access, modify, or delete.
        Game data stored on servers can be deleted by removing games within the app.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted at this URL,
        and the "Last updated" date will be revised. Continued use of the app after changes indicates
        acceptance of the updated policy.
    </p>

    <h2>Open Source</h2>
    <p>
        Offby1 Chess is open source software. You can review the source code to verify our privacy practices:
